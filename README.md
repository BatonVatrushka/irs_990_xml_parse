# irs_990_xml_parse
this repo includes code used to parse xml files from series 990 bulk downloads from irs.gov

You can retrieve the files from here: https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/form-990-series-downloads

This repo is a work in progress. I'll add code in the future which shows how you can pulls thousands (or millions) of rows of data from these files.
